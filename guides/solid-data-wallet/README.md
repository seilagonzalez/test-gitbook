# Solid Data Wallet

Developer Preview

* This tutorial uses the [Enterprise Solid Server (ESS) Wallet Service](https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/2.3/services/service-wallet/).
* Both the Data Wallet and the ESS Wallet Service are available as Developer Preview and are intended for testing and feedback purposes only, subject to change without notice.

Solid Data Wallet, built on Inruptâ€™s [Enterprise Solid Server Wallet Service](https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/2.3/services/service-wallet/) and utilizing Solid Pods, offers developers a white label application for storing and sharing personal data. This technical documentation outlines the installation, features and patterns, emphasizing a user-centric secure storage for consent-driven data sharing. Developers can integrate existing services and applications to create new data flows, implementing robust authorization and consent-driven data sharing for access. By using the Solid Data Wallet as a basis, organizations enhance data interoperability, improve insights, and empower users, all while adhering to a standards-based infrastructure that ensures privacy and compliance.

The Solid Data Wallet is a React Native application compatible with iOS 17 and Android 14 or newer versions of these operating systems.
